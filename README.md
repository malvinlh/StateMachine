# State Machine, Animator, Animation, NavMesh, and Cinemachine Camera Transition

This repository contains material that was used in one of the ITS Informatics Game Dev community meetings to learn about Unity.

For the playable character assets, you can access them [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/jammo-character-mix-and-jam-158456). Meanwhile, I created the character that chases you using Blender and used Mixamo for rigging and animating it.

Special thanks to the iHeartGameDev YouTube channel for the reference material. You can check out the video at the link below:
